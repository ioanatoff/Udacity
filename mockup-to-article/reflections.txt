You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  * I’ve learned:
	- how to use Atom (open files in it, write HTML and see the outcome in browser);
	- some HTML elements and notions (how they are structured and when to use them); 
	- how to structure my code while I’m writing it;
	- how to research in depth for some particular elements as <sup> for example;
	- I’ve created my very first GitHub repository.
  * It has been easy to find the informations on the web about HTML elements and to create website from a mockup. I’m really enjoying it.
  * It has been a bit difficult to choose the right HTML element for the requirements (for example the last row of the project mockup was a footer note and I wasn’t sure if I have to put it between <p>, <footer> or none of them) and also to understand why I have to write certain things in HTML (ex. the paragraph between <figcaption>).
  * I don’t think that I’ve encountered challenges this big till now, I like what I’m learning here.
